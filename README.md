# project_tea_cozy
Unit 4 Tea Cozy Project
I began this project over a week ago but encountered issues with the old repository last night when doing my final project review.  To save some time, I went ahead and created a new repository to submit for the project review.

I need to do some more research on GIT commands but for the sake of getting this project in tonight, I just uploaded the latest copies of the file directly to GitHub.

Thanks!
